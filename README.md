# PRNet-Depth-Generation 

---

## Introduction

A implementaion of depth generation based on [PRNet](https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet), which was used in the paper [Exploiting Temporal and Depth Information for Multi-frame Face Anti-spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05118)

## Prerequisite

* Python 3.6 (numpy, skimage, scipy)

* TensorFlow >= 1.4

  Optional:

* dlib (for detecting face.  You do not have to install if you can provide bounding box information. Other face detectors are ok if you want.)

* opencv2 (for showing results)

* Download the PRN trained model at [BaiduDrive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10vuV7m00OHLcsihaC-Adsw) or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UoE-XuW1SDLUjZmJPkIZ1MLxvQFgmTFH/view?usp=sharing), and put it into `Data/net-data`
